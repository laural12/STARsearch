# Step 1: Create a GitHub account
Create an account on GitHub if you don't have one already.

# Step 2: Configure an SSH key

## Generating a new SSH key
[Go here for more detailed instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key)

Open Terminal.
Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.
```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
```
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_algorithm): [Press enter]
```

At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."
```
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```

## Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

Start the ssh-agent in the background.
```
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid #####
```
Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access by running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent zsh to run the ssh-agent.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
```
$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

## Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account
[Go here for more detailed instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.
```
$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  # Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
```
In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.
In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal laptop, you might call this key "Personal laptop".
Select that this is an authentication key.
Paste your key into the "Key" field.
Click Add SSH key.
If prompted, confirm access to your account on GitHub.

# Step 3: Confirm Git is installed
[For more detailed steps, go here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html)

You can determine if Git is already installed on your computer by opening a terminal and running this command:
```
git --version
```

If Git is installed, the output is:
```
git version X.Y.Z
```

If your computer doesnâ€™t recognize git as a command, you must [install Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/how_to_install_git/index.html).

# Step 4: Configure git
Configure git with your name, email address, and preferred editor.

```
git config --global user.name "First Last"
git config --global user.email email@gmail.com
git config --global core.editor nano
```
Be sure to substitute your own name and email address.

# Step 5: Clone the repository
Open a terminal and go to the directory where you want to clone the files. Git automatically creates a folder with the repository name and downloads the files there.
Run this command:
```
git clone git@github.com:laural12/STARsearch.git
```
To view the files, go to the new directory:
```
cd STARsearch
```

[Here are instructions to clone your repository in Visual Studio](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/index.html#clone-and-open-in-visual-studio-code)

# Step 6: Initialize a git repository, commit your changes and push them to GitHub
On your local machine, and inside the STARsearch directory, initialize a git repository and commit your changes

First, enter the following in your terminal.
```
git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:username/projectpath.git
```

```
git init
git add <file-name OR folder-name>
git status
git commit -a -m "comment"
git push origin main
```
Note: you can add all files and folders with changes with git add . (including the period)

You now have a local git repository with this file committed. When you supply the "-m" flag, you put your commit message right on the command line. If you omit the "-m" flag, git will open the editor you configured and you can write the commit message in an editor. 

Before you move on, run the git status command and you will see that you have one commit that has not been pushed to the remote repository on GitHub.

Next, you will setup your repository so you can push your changes to your GItHub account. This is called a "remote" repository. You want to do this so that your files are all stored on GitHub, in case your laptop crashes.
